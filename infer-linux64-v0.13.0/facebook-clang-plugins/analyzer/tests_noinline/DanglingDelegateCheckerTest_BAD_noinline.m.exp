tests_noinline/DanglingDelegateCheckerTest_BAD_noinline.m:36:3: warning: Leaking unsafe reference to self stored in _worker1.delegate. The assign property 'delegate' of the instance of Worker stored in '_worker1' appears to occasionally point to self. For memory safety, you need to clear this property explicitly before losing reference to this object, typically by adding a line: '_worker1.delegate = nil;'. In case of a false warning, consider adding an assert instead: 'FBAssert(_worker1.delegate != self);' or, if applicable: 'FBAssert(!_worker1);'
