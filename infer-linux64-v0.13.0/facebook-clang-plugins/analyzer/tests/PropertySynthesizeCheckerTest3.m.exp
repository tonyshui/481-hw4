tests/PropertySynthesizeCheckerTest3.m:9:13: warning: The property value was originally declared in parent class Class1. The @synthesize statement here will create a new distinct ivar. This is usually not what you want. If this property was meant to be 'abstract' in the parent class, consider declaring it in a protocol or rewriting it as regular methods
@synthesize value = _value;
